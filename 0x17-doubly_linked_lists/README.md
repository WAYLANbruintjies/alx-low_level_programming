C
Algorithm
Data structure

Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

What is a doubly linked list
How to use doubly linked lists
Understand and know how to implement the various operations (deletion, insertion, etc) with doubly linked lists
Start to look for the right source of information without too much help

Tasks:

0. Print list
mandatory
Write a function that prints all the elements of a dlistint_t list.
File: 0-print_dlistint.c

1. List length
mandatory
Write a function that returns the number of elements in a linked dlistint_t list.
File: 1-dlistint_len.c

2. Add node
mandatory
Write a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a dlistint_t list.
File: 2-add_dnodeint.c

3. Add node at the end
mandatory
Write a function that adds a new node at the end of a dlistint_t list.
File: 3-add_dnodeint_end.c

4. Free list
mandatory
Write a function that frees a dlistint_t list.
File: 4-free_dlistint.c

5. Get node at index
mandatory
Write a function that returns the nth node of a dlistint_t linked list.
File: 5-get_dnodeint.c

6. Sum list
mandatory
Write a function that returns the sum of all the data (n) of a dlistint_t linked list.
File: 6-sum_dlistint.c

7. Insert at index
mandatory
Write a function that inserts a new node at a given position.
File: 7-insert_dnodeint.c, 2-add_dnodeint.c, 3-add_dnodeint_end.c

8. Delete at index
mandatory
Write a function that deletes the node at index index of a dlistint_t linked list.
File: 8-delete_dnodeint.c

9. Crackme4
#advanced
Find the password for crackme4.
Hint: The program prints “OK” when the password is correct
File: 100-password

10. Palindromes
#advanced
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 × 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
File: 102-result

11. crackme5
#advanced
Write a keygen for crackme5.
Usage of the crackme: ./crackme5 username key
The crackme will segfault if you do not enter the correct key for the user
Usage for your keygen: ./keygen5 username
Keygen should print a valid key for the username
File: 103-keygen.c
