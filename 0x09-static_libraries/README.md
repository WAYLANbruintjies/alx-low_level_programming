* 0x09. C - Static libraries
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

What is a static library, how does it work, how to create one, and how to use it Basic usage of ar, ranlib, nm

A library is not a luxury but one of the necessities of life mandatory Create the static library libmy.a File: libmy.a, main.h

Without libraries what have we? We have no past and no future mandatory Create a script called create_static_lib.sh that creates a static library called liball.a from all the .c files File: create_static_lib.sh
