* 0x08. C - Recursion

Learning Objectives At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
What is recursion How to implement recursion In what situations you should implement recursion In what situations you shouldnâ€™t implement recursion

She locked away a secret, deep inside herself, something she once knew to be true... but chose to forget mandatory Write a function that prints a string, followed by a new line. File: 0-puts_recursion.c

Why is it so important to dream? Because, in my dreams we are together mandatory Write a function that prints a string in reverse. File: 1-print_rev_recursion.c

Dreams feel real while we're in them. It's only when we wake up that we realize something was actually strange mandatory Write a function that returns the length of a string. File: 2-strlen_recursion.c

You mustn't be afraid to dream a little bigger, darling mandatory Write a function that returns the factorial of a given number. File: 3-factorial.c

Once an idea has taken hold of the brain it's almost impossible to eradicate mandatory Write a function that returns the value of x raised to the power of y. File: 4-pow_recursion.c

Your subconscious is looking for the dreamer mandatory Write a function that returns the natural square root of a number. File: 5-sqrt_recursion.c

Inception. Is it possible? mandatory Write a function that returns 1 if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise return 0. File: 6-is_prime_number.c

They say we only use a fraction of our brain's true potential. Now that's when we're awake. When we're asleep, we can do almost anything #advanced Write a function that returns 1 if a string is a palindrome and 0 if not. File: 100-is_palindrome.c

Inception. Now, before you bother telling me it's impossible... #advanced Write a function that compares two strings and returns 1 if the strings can be considered identical, otherwise return 0. File: 101-wildcmp.c
